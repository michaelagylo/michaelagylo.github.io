abstract: 'Abstract Successful adaptation often involves changes to the decision context
  to enable new ways of thinking and acting on climate change. Using 16 adaptation
  initiatives the authors were engaged with, we analysed how and why decision contexts
  changed to identify ways to improve adaptation as a process of collective deliberation
  and social learning. We used the scope of the adaptation issue and governance arrangements
  to classify initiatives into four types and scored changes in the decision context
  using three frameworks: (1) the values, rules and knowledge (VRK) perspective to
  identify changes to adaptation decision-making; (2) the five dimensions of futures
  consciousness to identify the building of adaptation capabilities and (3) the social
  learning cycle to reveal evidence of reflexive learning. Initiatives using novel
  governance arrangements for discrete problems (textquoteleftproblem governancetextquoteright)
  or complex, systemic issues (textquoteleftsystems governancetextquoteright) scored
  highest for influences of VRK, futures consciousness and the social learning cycle
  on the decision context. Initiatives using existing management for discrete problems
  (textquoteleftproblem managementtextquoteright) scored moderately for change in
  the decision context, while those using existing management for systemic issues
  (textquoteleftsystems managementtextquoteright) scored low because change was often
  impeded by existing rules. All three frameworks influenced decision contexts in
  systems governance initiatives. Problem governance initiatives revealed interactions
  of VRK and futures consciousness but limited influence of VRK on the social learning
  cycle. Scope and governance arrangements differ with the adaptation issue and initiatives
  adapt over time: some small-scale ones became more systemic, developed novel governance
  arrangements and changed the decision context. Our findings do not show that some
  adaptation initiatives are better or more transformative than others; just that
  their scope and appropriate governance arrangements are different. This questions
  the notion that successful adaptation requires building generic transformative adaptation
  approaches and capabilities. There is a diversity of arrangements that work. What
  is important is to align the approach to the adaptation problem. We suggest two
  directions for improving adaptation initiatives: first, by influencing how they
  can shift between problem and systems focus and between standard management and
  novel governance, and secondly, by using methods to diagnose and direct change in
  the decision context. Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the
