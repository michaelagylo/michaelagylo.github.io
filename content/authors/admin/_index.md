## About Me

Hello, my name is Michaela. I am a Postdoctoral researcher in DICE, University of Kent. My interests include land systems science, well-being, and food systems linked to social and environmental sustainability in forest landscapes. 
Outside of research, you will probably find me on a climbing wall, drinking coffee, writing some poems, or baking.
