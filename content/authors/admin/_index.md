## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in DICE, University of Kent. My research broadly centres
on the <b> environmental and social changes in the forest tropics </b> and further seeks to understand
the interventions, actions, and processes that lead 
towards more <b> sustainable and just future(s).</b> 
As an <b> interdisciplinary researcher</b>, I am also interested in diverse ways of 
        generating knowledge and evidence, and how they can be used for supporting
        more sustainable and just natural resource management practices and policies.

<p>  My current research projects include 
a) supporting land-use decisions to advancing sustainability goals (with a particular focus on mining and community forestry),
b) Using participatory visual methods and other alternative research methodologies to generate evidence for addressing complex sustainability issues and 
c) examining the human dimensions of forest and aquatic ecosystems in the tropics
</p>

<p> Before starting my PhD, I was based at the Center for International
Forestry Research (CIFOR) Headquarters in Bogor, Indonesia.
My work primarily focused on the interface between forests and aquatic 
ecosystems across the tropics and what implications this has for food 
security and nutrition.
</p>

<p> I am actively involved in several <b> equity & diversity </b> initiatives that aim to address the unequal barriers and risks in fieldwork, academia, and the broader environmental sector:</p>

        * Member of the <i>Equality and Diversity Working Group</i> (EDWG) for the British Ecological Society (BES)

        * Steering Committee member for <i>the Equity and Diversity for all Genders in Ecology</i> (EDGE) Gender Network, BES

        * Postgraduate <i>Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion</i> (EDI) representative in the School of Anthropology and Conservation (SAC), University of Kent </p1>
