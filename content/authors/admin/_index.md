## About Me
<p>  
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in DICE, University of Kent. My research broadly centres
on the <b> environmental and human dimensions of natural resource management in the forest tropics </b> and further seeks to understand
the interventions, actions, and processes that lead 
towards more sustainable and just future(s). 
As an <b> interdisciplinary researcher</b>, I am also interested in <b> diverse ways of 
        generating knowledge and evidence</b>, and how they can be used for supporting
        more sustainable and just natural resource management practices and policies.
</p>

<p>  My current research projects include the following: 
  -Supporting land-use decisions to advancing sustainability goals, with a particular focus on mining and community forestry,  
  -Using participatory visual methods and other alternative research methodologies to generate evidence for addressing complex sustainability issues, and  
  -Examining the human dimensions of forest and aquatic ecosystems in the tropics  
</p>

<p> I am actively involved in several <b> Equity & Diversity </b> initiatives that aim to address the unequal barriers and risks in fieldwork, academia, and the broader environmental sector, including: 
Member of the Equality and Diversity Working Group (EDWG) for the British Ecological Society (BES); steering Committee member for the Equity and Diversity for all Genders in Ecology (EDGE) Gender Network, BES; and member of the Women in Conservation Canterbury (WCCN) Network
