The [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0k36v50zvro) recently reported on the expansion of nickel mining Raja Ampat, located in Indonesia's West Papua province. 

In response, environmental campaigners within Indonesia mobilized a successful campaign, resulting in four of the five mining licences being [revoked](https://globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/transition-minerals/indonesias-amazon-of-the-seas-threatened-by-ev-nickel-rush/). This development in West Papua mirrors similar patterns seen in Sulawesi, just to the west of the region, where communities are also grappling with the localised impacts of nickel mining. These challenges are not isolated to West Papua, showing that these challenges are not isolated to this region. 

Across Indonesia, in places like [Bajau communities in Kabaena island](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-66131451) and [Obi island](https://thegeckoproject.org/articles/clean-cars-poisoned-water/), as well as internationally, such as more recently in the [Philippines](https://www.newmandala.org/extracting-value-losing-ground-the-critical-minerals-boom-in-palawan/), the effects of mining on local populations are deeply concerning.

While the progress in Papua is encouraging, similar accountability has yet to materialise elsewhere. In our article in [The Conservation](https://theconversation.com/weighing-the-green-cost-how-nickel-mining-in-indonesia-impacts-forests-and-local-communities-246259), we outline several ways to ensure that the nickel mining sector is just and sustainable.
